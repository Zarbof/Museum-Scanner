<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

We created a web app written in React.js and PHP designed to enhance the experience of museum visitors by allowing them to scan QR codes with their phones to receive more information about artifacts. We took inspiration from several existing apps designed for museums, as well as the requests of the Lelooska Foundation. The main features of the web app included a database to store artifacts, along with text information, photos, videos, and audio data for each one. Administrator features include editing this database and each artifact, as well as controlling an access token for privacy. Visitors are able to access the information about each artifact by scanning the corresponding QR code. In addition, another feature is the plant book, which has a database that can be scrolled through instead of scanning QR codes.
